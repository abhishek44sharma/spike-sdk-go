## About

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for reporting
security vulnerabilities in **SPIKE**, along with the
version support policy.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of **SPIKE** is currently being supported with 
security updates.

Note that **SPIKE** consists of more than a single component, and during a 
release cut, all components are signed and tagged with the same version.

After **SPIKE** hits a major 1.0.0. version, this will change,
and we will also have a support plan various major versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send your vulnerability reports to [security@spike.ist](mailto:spike.ist).

We don't have an official turnover time, but if nobody gets back
to you within a week please send another email.

We take all vulnerability reports seriously, and you will be notified
if your report is accepted or declined, and what further actions we are going
to take on it.
